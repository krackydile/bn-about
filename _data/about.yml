      Big Neon is a modern, mobile first platform that moves beyond just selling tickets to help leading music promoters increase their revenue and compete.


      The company is founded by Dan Teree, who co-founded Ticketfly, which was sold to Pandora in 2015 for $450M. Many in the industry have called Big Neon the "spiritual successor" to Ticketfly.
