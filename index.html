              <p>Big Neon is a modern, mobile first platform that moves beyond just selling tickets to help leading music promoters increase their revenue and compete.</p>
              <h2>Founder story</h2>
              <p>The company is founded by Dan Teree, who co-founded Ticketfly, which was sold to Pandora in 2015 for $450M. Many in the industry have called Big Neon the “spiritual successor” to Ticketfly.</p>

              <h2>Modern ticketing</h2>
              <p>Big Neon is ushering in the modern era of pure mobile ticketing where beautiful apps replace outmoded hard tickets and long will call lines. With Big Neon, promoters will capture a lot more marketing data and know who’s in their club. Beyond that, promoters will be able to communicate in powerful new ways - such as sending their patrons valuable ticketing and drink offers. Eventually, Big Neon intends to leverage the <a href="https://www.tari.com">Tari blockchain protocol</a> so that music promoters can capture revenues currently lost in the secondary market. Big Neon’s aim is nothing short of modernizing the way ticketing is done to help our clients compete.</p>

    <h2 class="display-2">What's our guiding principles?</h2>
    <div class="post">
        <p>Most ticketing companies try to get big by trying to be all things to all people. This inevitably leads to slow innovation because the company spreads itself thin trying to please too many different clients. Instead, Big Neon is committed to serving only one client: music promoters. This allows us to listen long and hard to our clients’ problems and build products that truly fit their needs. Better yet, it allows us to innovate faster.</p>
        <p>To ensure we keep our focus and deliver the innovation that the music industry craves, Big Neon follows four guiding principles:</p>

        <div class="service-item">
          <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/about/principle-music.png" />
          <h3>Only music</h3>
          <p>We serve one master - the music promoter. And everyone on the Big Neon team shares the same passion for building tools that help promoters succeed, and this includes making the fan experience modern and fun.</p>

          <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/about/principle-listen.png" />
          <h3>Listen and collaborate</h3>
          <p>The Big Neon platform is built in close collaboration with our clients. Listening closely ensures their problems are solved in a way that works best. It’s also essential to building features that help promoters make more money.</p>

          <h3>Beyond tickets</h3>
          <p>One of the most exciting things about Big Neon is that we are moving well beyond just selling tickets. Tackling problems like decreasing no show rates, increasing beverage per caps and capturing lost revenues in the resale market.</p>

          <h3>Modern and mobile</h3>
          <p>Big Neon is mobile first and beautiful. We seek to delight promoters and fans alike with rich design and style. After all, it’s not 2008.</p>
